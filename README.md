# 2.Logistic-Regression-on-churn-modelling
In order to explain logistic regression  i have taken churn modelling dataset,here why this logistic regression introduced because by using linear and multi-linear regression we cant handle outliers so in order to handle they introduced this algorithm.when we dealing  with this dataset we found unbalanced data that can be handled by using underfitting or overfitting. Perform the over sampling to the churn modelling dataset and build the logistic model with that over sample data.then i applied logistic regression model by using confusion matrix calculated accuaracy 68% even this is not good accuracy but what i try to show case from this algorithm is how to handle unbalanced data.I have done both oversamping and under sampling you can do any one this to get accuracy better.
